# Coursera_Capstone
This project is part of an online class. \n
The Capstone2.ipynb file is the notebook that uses data from FourSquare to investigate the fictional scenario of opening a restaurant in NYC. \n

In this fictional scenario, the project is running a simple preliminary investigation to find the best locations to open a MEXICAN RESTAURANT in New York City. New York City is a HUB for restaurants and already includes several Mexican Restaurants, however, one more will only add to the unique ambiance. The following are assumed since no OFFICIAL research is actually being done:
a.) Restaurants prefer to be located near to other restaurants.
b.) Restaurants prefer to be near their market. (E.g, Schools, Office Buildings, Parks)
c.) Restaurants prefer not to be near immediate competitors. (E.g. A mexican restaurant would not want to be in close proximity with another similar Mexican restaurant)
Data will be sourced from FourSquare Location data using Venues and filtering it out for restaurants.

Data is pulled from FourSquare and filtered for only Restaurants.
These locations are checked out on a map.
All Mexican Restaurants are highlighted (in their own dataset)
The restaurants are also grouped into clusters??
